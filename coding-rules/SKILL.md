# Coding Rules

## Naming Rules

- Be descriptive, be verbose.
- Avoid abbreviations and acronyms.
- Don't be clever; be clear.
- Don't use single-letter variable names except for loop indices or mathematical variables.

## Decoupling Principles

- Separate concerns by organizing code into modules, classes, or functions based on functionality.
- Use interfaces or abstract classes to define contracts between components.
- Avoid tight coupling by minimizing dependencies between components and using dependency injection where appropriate.

## SOLID Principles

- Single Responsibility Principle: A class or module should have one reason to change.
- Open/Closed Principle: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- Liskov Substitution Principle: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
- Interface Segregation Principle: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
- Dependency Inversion Principle: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.

## Information Hiding Principles

- Encapsulate implementation details and expose only necessary interfaces.
- Use access modifiers (e.g., private, protected) to restrict access to internal components.
- Avoid exposing internal data structures or implementation details that could lead to tight coupling or misuse by external code.
- Use abstraction to hide complexity and provide a clear API for users of the code.

## One Source of Truth Principles

- Avoid duplication of logic or data across the codebase.
- Centralize shared logic or data in a single location to ensure consistency and maintainability.
- Use constants, configuration files, or shared modules to store common values or logic that may be used across multiple components or layers of the application.

## Self-Documenting Code Principles

- Write code that is clear and easy to understand without needing additional comments.
- Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes that convey their purpose and intent.
- Avoid complex or convoluted logic that may require extensive comments to explain.
- Use comments sparingly and only to explain why certain decisions were made or to provide context that cannot be easily inferred from the code itself.

## Composition over Inheritance Principles

- Favor composition of objects and functions over class inheritance to achieve code reuse and flexibility.
- Use interfaces or abstract classes to define contracts for behavior, and implement those contracts with concrete classes or functions.
- Avoid deep inheritance hierarchies that can lead to tight coupling and make code difficult to maintain or extend.
- Use composition to create complex behavior by combining simpler components, rather than relying on inheritance to share behavior across classes.
